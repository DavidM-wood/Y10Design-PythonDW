		<h1> The Evolution of the Hockey Stick </h1>

		<p>The evolution of the hockey stick will start in the 1800s and go to 2020</p>

				<li>1800s-1920s:
					<br></br>
				- Hockey sticks were hand-carved from birch.
				<br></br>
			- In 1920, sticks were now two pieces. The blade was seperate from the shaft.</li> 


				<li>1926:
					<br></br>
				- Cy Denneny was the first profesional hockey player to use a curved stick in a game.</li> 

				<li>1950s:
					<br></br>
				- Manufactures started to wrap the blade in fiberglass to add strength and make them lighter.</li>

				<li>1960s:
					<br></br>
				- Manufactures started to wrap the shaft in fiberglass. This made them lighter, stronger, and cheaper to produce.
				<br></br>
				- Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita were the first to popularize curved sticks.</li>

				<li>1970s:
					<br></br>
				- Sher-Wood started to dominate the manufacturing business by making sticks made of aspen. These sticks were more durable.</li>

				<li>1980s:
					<br></br>
				- First stick made of aluminum was made. They were more durable and lightweight.</li>

				<li>1990s:
					<br></br>
				- Sticks made of aluminum were made popular by Wayne Gretzky. </li> 

				<li>1995:
					<br></br>
				- The first composite blade was made. They were lighter, flexible , and players were able to score more goals with them. Composite sticks were known to break easily because of the flexible properties.</li>

				<li>2000s:
					<br></br>
				- Easton developed the first one piece composite stick. Shots became harder, more accurate, and more deceptive. </li>

				<li>2010s:
					<br></br>
				- By 2010, every player in the NHL had switched to composite sticks.</li>

				<li>Today:
					<br></br>
				- Sticks today are very light with the lightest stick being as light as 350g.<br></br>
				- Blades flex to give extra power.
				<br></br>
				- The shape of the shafts have changed to different shapes.
				<br></br>
				- Sticks are made out of carbon-fibres and carbon-weaves.</li>
