# Loops help us to do a particular task many times
# Example 1

# The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible 
# to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(a, b, c) which means 
# values from 'a' to 'b' (but not including 'b') and increases by 3 each time
# for loop 
# the word for is used to indicated that it is happening for x many times
# range tells how many times it has to do it 
#

for x in range(0, 30, 3):
  print(x)
